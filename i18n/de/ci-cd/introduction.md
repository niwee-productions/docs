# Basics of CI/CD

## Introduction

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are two practices that are often used together to improve the speed and quality of software delivery. CI/CD is a software development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. By doing so, you can significantly reduce the cost, time, and risk of fixing bugs in the future.
